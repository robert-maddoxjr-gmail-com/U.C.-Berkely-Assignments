## 📂 Contents

### PA1 – [Assignment Title]
- **Focus:** Data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- **Key Takeaway:** Learned how to prepare raw data for machine learning models.  

### PA2 – [Assignment Title]
- **Focus:** Regression models and feature engineering  
- **Key Takeaway:** Applied regression techniques and explored the impact of feature transformations.  

### [PA3 – Practical_Application 3_Comparing_Classifiers (2).ipynb
- **Focus:** Evaluate multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM) on the **Bank Marketing dataset**.  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Accuracy was high across all models (~88–91%) but misleading due to class imbalance.  
  - Logistic Regression with `class_weight="balanced"` achieved the best F1-score (~25.6%), making it the most effective model for identifying customers who subscribed.  
- **Business Takeaway:** Even with lower overall accuracy, this model captures more "yes" responses, making it the superior choice for guiding bank marketing campaigns.
